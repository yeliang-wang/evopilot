EvoPilot helps teams operate AI-agent products as releasable software. It collects real evidence from runtime events, traces, evaluations, CI/CD, source changes, LLM calls, and user feedback; turns that evidence into reviewable evolution opportunities; waits for human approval; then drives code upgrades, delivery, and product-native `GO` / `NO-GO` release decisions.

It is not an agent runtime, a prompt playground, or a generic code generator. Agent runtimes do the work; EvoPilot governs whether the product is ready to evolve and release.

## Release Status

EvoPilot is marked **GA Release V1.0** for its product control plane and Loop Engineering runtime.

As of the **2026-07-07 production validation**, the EvoPilot SaaS multi-tenant deployment has reached **GA stable Release** status:

| Signal | Result |
|---|---:|
| Production user E2E checks | 92 |
| PASS | 88 |
| FAIL | 0 |
| Low-severity WARN | 4 |
| Production health | `UP` |
| Readiness | `READY` |
| Postgres business store | `READY` |
| Real LLM path | GLM-5.1 credits and tokens recorded |

The authoritative release verdict is exposed by:

```http
GET /api/v1/release/decisions
```

Detailed release evidence and deployment checklists live in [docs/saas-production-release-package.md](docs/saas-production-release-package.md) and [docs/production-user-e2e.md](docs/production-user-e2e.md).

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | What EvoPilot provides |
|---|---|
| Loop Engineering | Durable loop state, executor graphs, checkpoints, replay, watchdog recovery, worker leases, sandbox proof, and timeline audit. |
| GlobalGoal planning | A white-box goal layer above LoopRun that decomposes RC/GA objectives into ordered GoalTargets, binds each target to governed loops, and exposes progress, blockers, timeline, graph, evidence matrix, and final report. |
| Evidence ingestion | Runtime events, traces, logs, evaluations, release signals, APM-derived data, and user feedback. |
| Human approval | Reviewable proposals before high-risk evolution, source writeback, merge, or release actions. |
| Code upgrades | Bounded code-upgrader execution with allowed paths, validation commands, branch/commit evidence, and source closure. |
| CI/CD delivery | GitHub Actions and GitLab CI native project DevOps, deploy connectors, health gates, and pipeline evidence. |
| Release governance | Per-project release targets, evidence bundles, scenario matrices, risk registers, and `GO` / `CONDITIONAL-GO` / `NO-GO` decisions. |
| SaaS multi-tenancy | Platform admin, tenant admin, tenant user flows, workspace RBAC, tenant-aware evidence, quota foundations, and scoped secrets. |
| Dashboard | Chinese SaaS console for onboarding, projects, loops, approvals, release decisions, observability, tenants, users, and help manual workflows. |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22+
- npm

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run server:debug
```

Verify the API:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19876/health
http://127.0.0.1:19876/ready
```

Run the standalone Dashboard from the sibling repository:

```bash
cd ../evopilot-dashboard
EVOPILOT_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:19876 npm run dev
```

Debug mode is for local development and UI validation. Production mode is the default for real operation and requires authentication, real runtime boundaries, and configured LLM/source/CI/CD credentials.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the primary product surface for operators and tenant users, but it now lives in the standalone `yeliang-wang/evopilot-dashboard` repository. EvoPilot itself focuses on the API server, CLI, domain state, release governance, and execution control plane. The standalone Dashboard consumes EvoPilot APIs and includes the GlobalGoal Cockpit for RC/GA workflow visibility.

| Role | Main workflows |
|---|---|
| Platform admin | Create tenants, manage tenant admins, inspect SaaS readiness, observe cross-tenant release health. |
| Tenant admin | Manage workspace users, bind projects, configure credentials, run target loops, approve source/release actions. |
| Tenant user | Inspect projects, evidence, loop progress, approvals assigned to them, release decisions, and help manual steps. |

The full role-based and scenario-based operating guide is in [docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md).

## Architecture

EvoPilot applies Loop Engineering to product evolution. For larger RC/GA objectives, the GlobalGoal layer sits above LoopRun and turns one global objective into multiple GoalTargets before each target is executed through the governed loop runtime:

```text
GlobalGoal -> GoalTarget -> LoopRun -> Release Decision
                  |
                  v
Sandbox -> Context -> Harness -> Loop
```

| Layer | EvoPilot responsibility |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | Isolated execution boundaries, credential scope, protected paths, and deploy constraints. |
| Context | Durable loop state, evidence, artifacts, checkpoints, and replay context. |
| Harness | API control plane, RBAC, audit, worker leases, approvals, retries, and watchdog recovery. |
| Loop | Continue, stop, retry, approve, source-close, release, or route to humans. |

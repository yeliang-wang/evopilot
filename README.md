EvoPilot observes real AI-agent product behavior, turns evidence into reviewable evolution opportunities, waits for human approval, then drives Loop Runtime execution, code upgrades, Jenkins/GitLab delivery, release evidence, and auditable `GO` / `NO-GO` decisions.

It is not an agent runtime, a prompt playground, or a generic code generator. Agent runtimes do the work; EvoPilot governs whether the product is ready to evolve and release.

## Status

EvoPilot is marked **GA Release V1.0** for its product control plane and Loop Engineering runtime. The release standard is not a health-only soak: the GA target requires production-representative projects, successful evolution loops, code-upgrader changes, Jenkins/GitLab delivery, residual scenarios, active workload stability, and product-native `GO` / `NO-GO` release evidence.

The authoritative release verdict lives in:

```http
GET /api/v1/release/decisions
```

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | What EvoPilot provides |
|---|---|
| Continuous evolution control plane | Product-facing layers for evidence, decision, execution, governance, and continuity. |
| Loop Engineering | Durable Loop Runtime, typed executor graphs, ExecutorAdapter plugins, Dashboard orchestration presets, target-loop backlog, Codex target autopilot, replay with human context edits, sandbox enforcement evidence, worker leases, watchdog recovery, loop traces, and Dashboard timeline. |
| Evidence ingestion | Runtime events, OpenTelemetry traces/logs, SkyWalking data, evaluation results, and user feedback. |
| Opportunity discovery | Evidence clustering, failure attribution, dynamic baselines, scorecards, SLOs, and governance rules. |
| Human approval | Markdown evolution proposals that users can review and edit before execution. |
| Code upgrades | A code-upgrader runtime that creates branches, commits implementation changes, and returns review evidence. |
| CI/CD delivery | Jenkins-backed delivery after successful code upgrades, with pipeline status and artifacts retained. |
| Release governance | Product-native release targets, evidence bundles, scenario matrices, risk registers, and release decisions. |
| ProofOps target loops | Target-driven release/maturity loops that create a target plan, require plan approval, collect evidence, emit a ProofOps-compatible final report, and gate release actions behind approval. |
| Source-to-production closure | Every target loop carries `sourceClosure`; GitHub/GitLab/local projects expose source credential readiness, run a preflight gate before SCM writeback, then execute branch creation, file commits, PR/MR creation, tags, deploy URL evidence, health/ready probes, release policy, safe merge, post-merge deploy, and repair-candidate recovery. Missing SCM write credentials become first-class external blockers, and Dashboard lets users bind `tokenRef` or inline tokens before continuing the loop. |

## Loop Engineering Product Model

EvoPilot applies the Loop Engineering idea to AI Agent product evolution: long-running work must run inside execution boundaries, keep durable context, stay under product governance, and move through an explicit continue / stop / approve loop. The goal is not to expose a generic agent framework, but to make real product evolution recoverable, auditable, and releasable.

The Loop Engineering layered model, `Sandbox -> Context -> Harness -> Loop`, maps to EvoPilot this way:

| Loop Engineering layer | Product design question | EvoPilot capability |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox | Where can executors safely work, and what boundaries prevent unsafe product changes? | host/Docker/K8s sandbox policy, credential scope, network mode, allowed/denied paths, per-step workspaces, code-upgrader runtime, protected paths, Jenkins/GitLab delivery boundaries, production mode checks |
| Context | What state, evidence, artifacts, and intermediate results survive across rounds? | durable `LoopRun` state, file/SQLite/Postgres store contract, replay context patch, timeline, evidence sets, artifacts, project profile, evaluation datasets, release evidence |
| Harness | Who controls the run, what must be approved, and how are failures recovered? | API control plane, RBAC, approval gates, audit records, worker lease locks, idempotent recovery, watchdog, retry/stop policy, structured logs |
| Loop | When does the task continue, stop, retry, route to humans, or produce a release decision? | trigger rules, resume/cancel/approve APIs, release targets, ProofOps target loops, `GO` / `CONDITIONAL-GO` / `NO-GO` decisions |

This is the design center for EvoPilot V1.0: let Agent-product evolution run for long tasks without losing context, bypassing governance, or mistaking executor progress for product readiness.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run server:debug
```

Open the dashboard:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19876/
```

Debug mode is for local development and UI validation. Production mode is the default for real operation and requires authentication plus real LLM/runtime boundaries.

## GA Release Target

The built-in `ga` release target requires:

| Criterion | Default |
|---|---:|
| Connected production-representative projects | 5 |
| Active successful soak duration | 5400 seconds |
| Active workload run delta | 5 |
| Active code-upgrade delta | 5 |
| Active CI/CD pipeline delta | 5 |
| Successful runs, evolution batches, code upgrades, and pipelines | 5 each |
| Required release scenarios | 11 |
| Mainstream Loop Harness alignment | Required evidence against LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, E2B, Temporal, and DBOS-style baselines |

Run the active stability proof:

```bash
npm run release:soak:ga:active
```

Generate release evidence:

```http
POST /api/v1/release/evidence
```

The latest decision can return `GO`, `CONDITIONAL-GO`, or `NO-GO`, with per-criterion evidence.

## Field Evidence Kit

EvoPilot ships a reusable Field Evidence Kit so the Source-to-GA loop can be demonstrated and reproduced without turning product behavior into fake dashboard data.

| Asset | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub demo project onboarding | `examples/github-demo-projects/` and Dashboard `项目` | Product Kit: prefill a real project registration payload and submit it through `/api/v1/projects`. |
| Sample evidence import | Dashboard `工作区` | Product Kit: write minimal real evidence through `/api/v1/evidence/events`, then run Discovery and create Target Backlog. |
| GitHub workflow templates | `examples/github-workflows/` | Product Kit: show how issues, PR comments, CI failures, and release blockers can call EvoPilot. |
| Executor adapter examples | `examples/executor-adapters/` | Product Kit: show how external agent or workflow runtimes fit behind `ExecutorAdapter`. |
| Case studies and comparisons | `docs/case-studies/`, `docs/comparisons/` | Product Kit: make the product boundary and mainstream loop-harness alignment auditable. |
| Soak reports and screenshots | `evidence/production-soak/` | Evidence Output: generated by real runs; useful for release proof, not hard-coded product state. |

The kit deliberately separates **reusable product assets** from **per-run proof artifacts**. Demo projects, workflow templates, tutorials, adapter examples, and case-study templates belong to the product. A concrete `loopId`, screenshot, release decision JSON, trace transcript, or soak report belongs to the evidence archive produced by a run.

## Loop Runtime

EvoPilot now has a first-class Loop Runtime for Loop Engineering. It is the continuity and execution substrate of the continuous evolution control plane: long-running agent-product tasks can be triggered from API, Codex, IM, schedules, runtime signals, release targets, or evolution batches, then advanced through durable run state, executor graphs, independent evidence sets, stop/retry policy, heartbeat leases, watchdog recovery, human approval, and timeline audit.

Run the integrated gate:

```bash
npm run loop-runtime:check
npm run loop:soak
```

```

The runtime is the common substrate for continuous product evolution, release readiness loops, Codex commands, and IM adapters. Release and other high-risk actions stay inside the loop, but they are guarded by explicit approval gates. The same substrate is used when EvoPilot manages `evopilot-self`: target-loop work is tracked in EvoPilot, code-upgrader/Codex acts as an executor, and GitHub/ECS delivery evidence is written back to the loop instead of living only in an external terminal transcript.

Every target loop also has a source-to-production closure state machine. When a loop is created, EvoPilot records `sourceClosure`: the registered source project, repository provider, Git URL or server-local root, source branch, target version, release strategy, required gates such as `code-change`, `push`, `tag`, `deploy`, `health-ready`, and deployment environment. If the caller does not provide it, EvoPilot derives it from the registered project.

For GitHub, GitLab, and local Git repositories, an admin can execute the closure through `POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/execute` or the Dashboard “执行闭环” action. EvoPilot creates a release branch, commits requested files, opens a PR or MR for remote providers, creates a tag when the loop requires `tag`, invokes a configured deploy connector for the `deploy` gate, probes health/ready URLs, and writes `closureState`, `gateEvidence`, commit/tag/PR/MR/deployment artifacts, audit records, and independent evidence back into `LoopRun.sourceClosure`. Each execution also creates an auditable `evopilot-source-release-closure-run/v1` record that exposes the release stages, review status, release policy status, auto-merge status, post-merge deployment status, merge status, next action, capabilities, source ref, artifacts, and status through `GET /api/v1/source-release-runs`, `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-release-runs`, and `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/plan`. `POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/review-decision` records release approval or rejection, evaluates policy gates before merge, blocks unsafe merges with persisted blocker evidence, can run safe `auto-merge`, and merges the GitHub PR, GitLab MR, or local release branch back to the source branch while persisting the merge commit, reviewer evidence, and post-merge deploy/health result. Failed or stale release runs can be recovered from the Dashboard Release Run Auto Repair Workbench or through `GET /api/v1/source-release-runs/repair-candidates` and `POST /api/v1/source-release-runs/repair-candidates/repair`; repaired runs reuse the same source-closure path, write audit/evidence records, and leave the queue after promotion. The release states distinguish planned, code changed, pushed, tagged, deployed, health-ready, health-failed, rolled-back, promoted, and failed outcomes, so a rollout that is reverted after health failure is not reported as a promoted release. This is a real SCM and deployment boundary, not only metadata. Built-in deploy connectors cover HTTP webhooks and bounded ECS Docker Compose rollouts with deploy locks, idempotency stamps, compose-failure rollback, post-deploy health-ready rollback, and post-merge deployment closure; K8s/cloud-specific deployers can be attached through the same connector contract.

The Dashboard also exposes a closed-loop orchestration workbench. `GET /api/v1/loop-orchestration/presets` lists productized loop presets, and `POST /api/v1/loop-orchestration/instantiate` creates a standard source-to-production target loop with a typed executor graph, Docker sandbox enforcement evidence, worker/watchdog continuity, deploy connector binding, and health-ready rollback semantics. When the Dashboard Workflow Canvas Editor submits routing and release-gate choices, EvoPilot now converts that visual canvas into a persisted `evopilot-executor-graph/v1` contract instead of storing it only as UI context. `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/executor-graph` returns the loop-bound graph, coordination plan, validation result, capabilities, and evidence, while `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/events` emits an `executor-graph` stream event for the same contract. `GET /api/v1/loop-orchestration/targets` exposes the product target backlog across Sandbox, Context, Harness, and Loop layers; `POST /api/v1/loop-orchestration/advance` creates or advances the next Codex-backed target loop, records next action and stop condition, and keeps acceptance criteria as loop context. `POST /api/v1/loop-orchestration/autopilot` is the production self-evolution autopilot: it advances a target through bounded loop iterations, stops at human gates unless explicitly approved, executes source closure with an auditable change artifact, evaluates release policy, runs safe auto-merge, and closes with post-merge deployment evidence. If autopilot reaches an external dependency it cannot repair itself, such as a missing or unresolved GitHub/GitLab writeback token, it returns `BLOCKED / nextAction=configure-source-credentials` with an `evopilot-external-blocker/v1` payload; Dashboard shows the recovery action in Target Loop Backlog and provides a source credential form so users can bind a server-side `tokenRef` or inline token, save, preflight, and resume the same target loop. Executor graphs now preserve typed edges, conditional routes, fan-out/fan-in edges, nested subgraph markers, and schema validation evidence in the graph contract.

The GA-alignment target backlog is now product runtime capability, not only backlog labels. Discovery runtime scans registered GitHub/GitLab/local projects plus trace, evaluation, production, and manual signals into `evopilot-discovery-skill-candidate/v1` records and writes provenance into the memory inbox. Per-finding handoff allocates an isolated workspace, target branch, allowed paths, validation commands, and rollback metadata. The adversarial evaluator independently challenges loop evidence and blocks missing source-closure or release-decision proof. Recurring schedules persist cadence, trigger rules, budget, next-run time, and idempotency key. The memory inbox stores findings, feedback, failed evaluations, release learnings, and operator notes for triage or conversion. Budget and judgment guardrails evaluate cost, tokens, duration, changed files, confidence, and release judgment before autonomous loops proceed.

The same target backlog now includes the SaaS cloud-service evolution path for opening EvoPilot as a shared platform. Tenant/workspace defaults, workspace RBAC and invitation, scoped project ownership, encrypted secret refs, GitHub App installation readiness, workspace quotas, tenant-aware release evidence, cross-tenant regression coverage, and SaaS observability are implemented as real APIs and functional tests. Postgres-backed loop storage remains an explicit readiness gate: `GET /api/v1/loop-store/readiness` returns `BLOCKED` until `EVOPILOT_LOOP_STORE_BACKEND=postgres` and a DSN are configured, so this cannot be hidden by Dashboard success.

The SaaS GA ladder is exposed through `GET /api/v1/loop-orchestration/targets` and advances in this order: `tenant-workspace-model`, `workspace-rbac-and-invitation`, `github-app-onboarding`, `secret-vault-and-credential-boundary`, `project-workspace-ownership`, `quota-rate-limit-billing-foundation`, `worker-queue-and-postgres-store`, `tenant-aware-release-evidence`, `multi-tenant-security-regression-suite`, `saas-production-observability`, `saas-onboarding-dashboard`, `saas-field-e2e-source-to-ga`, `saas-release-matrix`, `saas-ga-soak-active`, `saas-ga-release-decision`, and only then `announce-saas-multi-tenant-ga-stable`. These are product target objects, not temporary validation prompts. The final release claim is valid only when `GET /api/v1/release/decisions` returns a SaaS GA `GO` decision for the multi-tenant target.

The same Dashboard page now includes reusable product workbenches for the remaining loop-harness gaps. Release Closure Runtime reads source-release run records, refreshes the current source-to-production plan from `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/plan`, and exposes approve, merge, and safe auto-merge controls backed by `POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/review-decision`; the view shows policy blockers and post-merge deployment status before an operator promotes a release. Release Run Auto Repair Workbench lists failed or stale release runs, supports row-level repair and batch repair, and removes a candidate after the repaired run reaches `PROMOTED`. A production drill on the ECS deployment verified this path with a local Git target moving from `PLANNED` to `FAILED` on a dirty worktree and then to `PROMOTED` after Dashboard repair. Context Time Travel lists checkpoints from `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/checkpoints`, lets an operator edit context JSON, and submits `POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/time-travel/replay` to continue from the selected iteration with a replay diff. Worker Queue Workbench uses `GET /api/v1/loop-workers/queue` and `POST /api/v1/loop-workers/claim` to show claimable loops, active or expired leases, crash-resume readiness, and duplicate source-closure side-effect protection. Sandbox Boundary Workbench exposes executable Docker/K8s boundary proof through `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/sandbox-proof` and writes verification evidence through `POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/sandbox-proof/verify`. Streaming Trace Workbench uses `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/trace-tree` and `GET /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/events` for trace tree, checkpoint, cost, failure-group, replay-diff, sandbox-proof, and SSE event inspection.

## Self-Hosted Improvement Loop

EvoPilot can register an EvoPilot checkout or remote EvoPilot repository as an EvoPilot-managed target project and create a bounded self-improvement loop:

```bash
EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN=<admin-token> npm run self-loop
```

By default this command only performs controlled setup:

- registers `evopilot-self` through `POST /api/v1/projects` with a verified repository.
- ingests a real improvement signal through `POST /api/v1/evidence/events`.
- creates `evopilot-self-executor-adapter-contract` through `POST /api/v1/loops`.
- records allowed paths, validation commands, non-goals, and the human approval boundary in loop context.

It does not mutate the running controller process by itself. Source release closure is now an explicit admin action: after the loop produces reviewable files or a Dashboard user triggers the closure action, EvoPilot can write to GitHub/GitLab through the registered repository credentials and record branch/commit/PR/MR/tag/health evidence. To start exactly one Loop Runtime iteration after setup, opt in explicitly:

```bash
EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN=<admin-token> EVOPILOT_SELF_LOOP_START=1 npm run self-loop
```

Useful overrides:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EVOPILOT_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:19876` | EvoPilot control-plane URL. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER` | `local-git` | Target repository provider: `local-git`, `github`, or `gitlab`. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_REPO_ROOT` | current working directory | Target checkout to register. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_PROJECT_ID` | `evopilot-self` | Project id for the self-hosted target. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_LOOP_ID` | `evopilot-self-executor-adapter-contract` | Loop id, useful when starting a fresh candidate loop. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_OWNER` / `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_REPO` | none | GitHub target owner and repository when `EVOPILOT_SELF_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=github`. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_TOKEN_REF` | none | Environment variable name available to the EvoPilot server, used to verify the GitHub target. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITLAB_BASE_URL` / `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID` | none | GitLab target coordinates when `EVOPILOT_SELF_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=gitlab`. |
| `EVOPILOT_SELF_GITLAB_TOKEN_REF` | none | Environment variable name available to the EvoPilot server, used to verify the GitLab target. |

For a production server managing this repository, register the remote GitHub target instead of a Mac-local path:

```bash
EVOPILOT_BASE_URL=https://evopilot.example.com \
EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN=<admin-token> \
EVOPILOT_SELF_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=github \
EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_OWNER=yeliang-wang \
EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_REPO=EvoPilot \
EVOPILOT_SELF_GITHUB_TOKEN_REF=GITHUB_TOKEN \
npm run self-loop
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` must be configured in the EvoPilot server environment, because repository validation is executed by the server.

## ProofOps Target Loop Mode

EvoPilot includes ProofOps Mode as a target-driven release/maturity loop engine. ProofOps remains the Core contract layer for target presets, evidence matrix vocabulary, non-mock evidence rules, and final report compatibility; EvoPilot owns execution, state, approval, audit, remediation, and release actions.

Run the integrated gate:

```bash
npm run proofops-mode:check
```

Primary API flow:

```http
POST /api/v1/conversations/commands
POST /api/v1/target-loops
POST /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/approve-plan
POST /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/resume
GET /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/final-report
POST /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/route-remediation
POST /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/release-actions/{action}/approve
POST /api/v1/target-loops/{loopId}/release-actions/{action}/execute
POST /api/v1/loops/{loopId}/source-closure/execute
```

Codex, Feishu, WeCom, and future IM adapters should use `/api/v1/conversations/commands` as the conversation gateway backend. Release actions are part of the ProofOps target loop, but require approval after `GO` and explicit execution after approval.

## 控制台

Dashboard 位于 `apps/dashboard/`，当前一级菜单已经按 SaaS 服务化和多租户控制面组织。默认首屏不是概念说明页，而是面向第一次使用的启动台：`接入项目 -> 配置凭据 -> 启动 Loop -> 查看发布证据`。Source-to-GA 仍然是核心执行链路，但它被放入 `Tenant -> Workspace -> Project -> Loop -> Release Evidence -> Audit` 的上下文中运行；租户、工作区和凭据边界作为操作前提展示，不打断首条 Loop 的上手路径。

| 菜单 | 用途 |
|---|---|
| 租户总览 | 默认展示首次启动清单、Loop 模板中心、下一步动作、tenant/workspace 状态、配额和服务化演进路线。用户优先完成第一条 Source-to-GA Loop，管理员仍能看到 `tenant-workspace-model`、GitHub App 接入、Secret Vault 边界、Postgres Worker Queue。 |
| 工作区 | 展示 workspace 成员、角色、项目、Loop、发布证据和 SaaS targets，并保留 Source-to-GA 向导、Target Runtime、Target Loop Backlog。 |
| 项目 | 通过 GitHub、GitLab 或本地 Git 注册项目，验证源码归属和项目级工作区；Field Evidence Kit 仍作为可复现样例入口。 |
| 凭据 | 作为 workspace 级凭据中心，聚合 GitHub App、source writeback、deploy credentials、LLM provider keys 和 audit redaction，避免多租户后凭据散落在项目表单或环境变量里。 |
| Loops | 默认把 Loop 分为“当前、待处理、历史”三组，优先显示下一步和状态；需要 trace、replay、sandbox、worker queue、Workflow Canvas 时再进入高级控制台。 |
| 发布证据 | 默认先给出 `GO` / `CONDITIONAL-GO` / `NO-GO`、PR、merge commit、post-merge deploy 和下一步动作；完整 evidence matrix、guardrail、repair queue 和 deploy finalizer 保留在高级视图。 |
| 审计 | 查看已完成演进、验证证据、产物和审计链路。 |
| 帮助手册 | 按公有云帮助中心的信息架构展示文档中心、本页目录、快速上手流程、角色权限、操作场景、前提条件、操作步骤、结果验证、后续操作和相关 API。 |

旧入口仍保持兼容：`首页` / `工作台` 映射到 `租户总览`，`主链路` / `主链路向导` / `向导` 映射到 `工作区`，`项目接入` / `接入项目` 映射到 `项目`，`证据策略` / `发现与目标` / `评测集` / `机会点` 映射到 `工作区`，`Loop` / `Loop 执行` 映射到 `Loops`，`流水线` / `发布` / `评估与发布` 映射到 `发布证据`，`历史记录` / `历史审计` / `历史` 映射到 `审计`。

Loops 页不再把所有运行细节堆在一张长页。默认页回答“现在该处理哪个 Loop”，并在没有运行记录时直接给出可点击模板，而不是只展示空状态。高级控制台仍提供总览、详情和创建三类工作区：总览页处理 Target Backlog、Loop Runtime 列表和 Worker Queue；Loop 详情页回答“这个 Loop 走到哪一步、为什么卡住、下一步做什么”；创建页回答“如何创建或调整新的 Loop graph”。详情页里的 Source-to-GA 动态本体链路图不是静态流程图；它把当前选中的 LoopRun 与项目、Discovery、Target Backlog、ExecutorGraph、worker/sandbox、human gate、`sourceClosure`、deploy finalizer、`sourceReleaseRun` 和 release decision 合成一条可读链路：`SCM/Git Project -> Discovery Candidate -> Target Backlog -> Executor Graph -> Worker + Sandbox -> Human Gate -> Source Closure -> CI/CD + Deploy -> Release Decision -> GA Release`。

租户总览会展示 workspace 数量、项目数、凭据阻塞、发布证据、Loop 配额、项目配额和 evidence storage 配额，同时提供 `GitHub 项目到 GA Release`、`已有 CI 项目接入`、`失败发布修复`、`EvoPilot 自演进` 四类模板入口。当前页面中的 tenant/workspace 数据先作为控制台信息架构和操作心智落点；后续服务化实现应把它们接入真实 tenant store、workspace membership、GitHub App installation、secret vault、quota/billing、Postgres loop store 和 worker queue。

也可以只打开静态控制台：

```bash
npm run dashboard
```

静态打开时会使用页面内置示例数据；连接服务端时会读取真实 API。

| 评测结果 | `POST /api/v1/evidence/evaluations` | 接收 Eval、Regression Suite、语义测试或 CI 回归结果。 |
| 用户反馈 | `POST /api/v1/evidence/feedback` | 接收差评、投诉、满意度、人工标注等反馈。 |

EvoPilot 不替代 SkyWalking、Prometheus、Tempo 或日志平台。EvoPilot 负责把这些可观测性信号转化为产品进化机会，并进入可验证交付闭环。

详细说明见 [docs/evidence-ingestion.md](docs/evidence-ingestion.md)。

## 项目接入

项目必须先注册并验证通过，才能进入证据策略、机会点和流水线。

支持的项目来源：

- `local-git`：本地 Git 仓库。
- `gitlab`：GitLab 仓库。
- `github`：GitHub 仓库。

Dashboard 注册弹窗会要求填写 Git URL、本地目录、默认分支、用户名、密码、Token 或 Token 环境变量。凭据只用于验证和后续代码升级闭环，API 响应不会明文返回敏感字段。

## LLM 能力

EvoPilot 的 LLM Gateway 已对齐 `domainforge-fabric-llm` 的通用能力，包括：

- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions 调用。
- intent / profile 路由。
- thinking profile。
- 长上下文压缩。
- 输出截断后的 token 放大重试。
- provider、model、token、耗时和压缩 trace。
- LLM metrics JSONL。
- 密钥脱敏。

当前强制使用真实 LLM 的产品链路：

| 链路 | 作用 |
|---|---|
| Loop Runtime `llm` executor | 在 `start/resume/replay/advance/autopilot` 中调用真实 LLM 生成本轮计划，并把 `provider`、`model`、`totalTokens`、`costUsd` 写入 executor output、evidence set 和 trace。 |
| `POST /api/v1/rules/compile` | 将用户 Prompt 编译为系统执行规则，并写入 Markdown。 |
| `POST /api/v1/opportunity-drafts` | 将多个评测集生成可编辑 Markdown 进化方案。 |

默认 LLM 配置文件：

```text
data/evopilot/llm.env
```

生产模式下，`EVOPILOT_REQUIRE_LLM=true` 且没有真实 `EVOPILOT_LLM_BASE_URL`、`EVOPILOT_LLM_MODEL_NAME`、`EVOPILOT_LLM_API_KEY` 时，服务会直接拒绝启动并返回 `EVOPILOT_PROD_REQUIRES_LLM_PROVIDER`。Loop executor 不再把 `llm` 节点空跑为成功；真实 provider 调用失败会让该节点失败并写入 failure signature。只有 `EVOPILOT_RUN_MODE=debug` 才允许无 provider 的本地调试兜底。

证据策略编译会做二次语义校验。比如“所有链路调用小于 3 秒”代表目标状态，执行触发条件必须是超过 3000ms 的风险信号；如果 LLM 把它错误编译成 `durationMs <= 3000`，系统会拒绝落盘和执行该规则。

## 运行模式

EvoPilot 默认以生产模式启动。

```bash
npm run server
```

生产模式要求：

- 必须配置 `EVOPILOT_TOKENS` 或 `EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN`。
- `EVOPILOT_REQUIRE_LLM` 默认是 `true`，并且必须配置真实 LLM provider。
- 不允许匿名 admin。
- 不允许模拟集成链路。
- 不自动注册内置项目画像。
- 不开放样例评测集。

本地调试必须显式启动：

```bash
npm run server:debug
```

常用环境变量：

| 变量 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `EVOPILOT_RUN_MODE` | 运行模式，默认 `prod`；本地调试使用 `debug`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_PORT` | HTTP 端口，默认 `19876`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_HOST` | 监听地址，默认 `127.0.0.1`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_DATA_ROOT` | 持久化目录，默认 `data/evopilot`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_TOKENS` | 多 Token 配置，格式为 `name:token:role`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN` | 单一管理员 Bearer Token。 |
| `EVOPILOT_DASHBOARD_ROOT` | Dashboard 静态资源目录，默认 `apps/dashboard`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_ENV_FILE` | LLM 配置文件路径，默认 `data/evopilot/llm.env`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible LLM 服务地址。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_MODEL_NAME` | 模型名称。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_API_KEY` | 模型服务密钥。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_PROVIDER_NAME` | provider 名称，例如 `zhipu`。 |
| `EVOPILOT_LLM_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS_USD` | 可选；用于 Dashboard trace 估算本轮 LLM 成本，真实扣费仍以 provider 账单为准。 |
| `EVOPILOT_CODE_UPGRADER_BASE_URL` | EvoPilot 代码升级托管运行时地址。 |
| `EVOPILOT_PRODUCT_JENKINS_BASE_URL` | 外部 Jenkins 系统默认连接器地址；项目可在注册时配置独立 Jenkins 覆盖。 |

完整部署说明见 [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)。

## Docker

构建镜像：

```bash
docker build -t evopilot:1.0.0 .
```

运行容器：

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 19876:19876 \
  -e EVOPILOT_TOKENS='admin:change-me-admin-token:admin,operator:change-me-operator-token:operator,viewer:change-me-viewer-token:viewer' \
  -v evopilot-data:/var/lib/evopilot \
  evopilot:1.0.0
```

或使用 Docker Compose：

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## 构建与测试

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:unit
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:functional
npm run test:e2e
```

完整检查：

```bash
npm run check
```

真实 LLM E2E：

```bash
npm run test:e2e:real-llm
```

真实生产链路 E2E：

```bash
npm run test:e2e:production
```

真实生产链路不会降级为模拟执行。缺少真实代码升级执行器、外部 Jenkins CI/CD 连接器、真实项目配置或真实 LLM 时，测试会失败或以阻断状态结束。

## 与 SkyWalking 的关系

EvoPilot 可以接收 SkyWalking 链路或查询结果转换后的 JSON，但 EvoPilot 不替代 SkyWalking。

推荐组合方式：

```text
SkyWalking / OpenTelemetry / 日志平台 / Eval / 用户反馈
-> EvoPilot 进化证据接入层
-> 证据策略
-> 机会点
-> 代码升级
-> CI/CD
-> 历史记录与审计
```

SkyWalking 更关注服务观测、链路追踪和诊断；EvoPilot 更关注如何把这些证据变成 AI Agent 产品的可控进化。

## 当前状态

EvoPilot 已具备可运行的产品闭环代码、中文 Dashboard、真实 LLM 链路、证据接入层、项目注册、代码升级执行边界、GitHub/GitLab 源码闭环写回、HTTP webhook 部署连接器、外部 Jenkins CI/CD 连接器边界和测试套件。

发布到生产环境前，至少需要完成：

- 为目标环境配置真实 `EVOPILOT_TOKENS`。
- 配置真实 LLM。
- 配置真实项目接入凭据。
- 配置或启动代码升级执行器。
- 配置系统默认 Jenkins，或在项目注册时配置项目独立 Jenkins。
- 为需要自动发布的 loop 配置 deploy connector。
- 通过 `npm run check` 和 `npm run test:e2e:production`。

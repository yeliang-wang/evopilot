EvoPilot helps teams operate AI-agent products as releasable software. It collects real evidence from runtime events, traces, evaluations, CI/CD, source changes, LLM calls, and user feedback; turns that evidence into reviewable evolution opportunities; waits for human approval; then drives code upgrades, delivery, and product-native `GO` / `NO-GO` release decisions.

It is not an agent runtime, a prompt playground, or a generic code generator. Agent runtimes do the work; EvoPilot governs whether the product is ready to evolve and release.

## Release Status

EvoPilot is marked **GA Release V1.0** for its product control plane and Loop Engineering runtime.

As of the **2026-07-07 production validation**, the EvoPilot SaaS multi-tenant deployment has reached **GA stable Release** status:

| Signal | Result |
|---|---:|
| Production user E2E checks | 92 |
| PASS | 88 |
| FAIL | 0 |
| Low-severity WARN | 4 |
| Production health | `UP` |
| Readiness | `READY` |
| Postgres business store | `READY` |
| Real LLM path | GLM-5.1 credits and tokens recorded |

The authoritative release verdict is exposed by:

```http
GET /api/v1/release/decisions
```

Detailed release evidence and deployment checklists live in [docs/reference/release-package.md](docs/reference/release-package.md) and [docs/reference/production-user-e2e.md](docs/reference/production-user-e2e.md).

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | What EvoPilot provides |
|---|---|
| Loop Engineering | Durable loop state, executor graphs, checkpoints, replay, watchdog recovery, worker leases, sandbox proof, and timeline audit. |
| GlobalGoal planning | A white-box goal layer above LoopRun that takes a business objective, decomposes it through Alpha -> Beta -> RC -> GA GoalTargets, waits for plan approval, binds each target to governed loops, and exposes progress, blockers, timeline, graph, evidence matrix, phase packages, and final report. |
| Evidence ingestion | Runtime events, traces, logs, evaluations, release signals, APM-derived data, and user feedback. |
| Human approval | Reviewable proposals before high-risk evolution, source writeback, merge, or release actions. |
| Code upgrades | Bounded code-upgrader execution with allowed paths, validation commands, branch/commit evidence, and source closure. |
| CI/CD delivery | GitHub Actions and GitLab CI native project DevOps, deploy connectors, health gates, and pipeline evidence. |
| LLM profiles | Tenant/workspace-scoped LLM profiles for public or private OpenAI-compatible models, project defaults, per-run overrides, readiness preflight, provider/model visibility, and token/credit accounting. |
| Release governance | Per-project release targets, evidence bundles, scenario matrices, risk registers, and `GO` / `CONDITIONAL-GO` / `NO-GO` decisions. |
| SaaS multi-tenancy | Platform admin, tenant admin, tenant user flows, workspace RBAC, tenant-aware evidence, quota foundations, and scoped secrets. |
| Dashboard | Chinese SaaS console for onboarding, projects, loops, approvals, release decisions, observability, tenants, users, and help manual workflows. |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22+
- npm

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run server:debug
```

Verify the API:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19876/health
http://127.0.0.1:19876/ready
```

Run the standalone Dashboard from the sibling repository:

```bash
cd ../evopilot-dashboard
EVOPILOT_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:19876 npm run dev
```

Debug mode is for local development and UI validation. Production mode is the default for real operation and requires authentication, real runtime boundaries, and configured LLM/source/CI/CD credentials.

## CLI For AI Agents

The EvoPilot CLI is an HTTP client for remote EvoPilot API servers. WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, CI jobs, and local terminals can install the CLI, point it at a production EvoPilot server, and drive governed Goal/Loop Target workflows without running EvoPilot on the same machine.

```bash
export EVOPILOT_SERVER="https://evopilot.example.com"
export EVOPILOT_API_TOKEN="<operator-or-admin-token>"
export EVOPILOT_TENANT="tenant-production"
export EVOPILOT_WORKSPACE="workspace-agent-products"
export EVOPILOT_ACTOR="workbuddy"
export EVOPILOT_CLI_CLIENT="workbuddy"

evopilot status --json
evopilot secret set --id LLM_API_KEY_MY_AGENT --kind llm-key --from-env LLM_API_KEY_MY_AGENT --json
evopilot llm profile set my-agent-llm --provider openai-compatible --base-url https://llm.example.com/v1 --model qwen2.5-coder-32b --api-key-ref LLM_API_KEY_MY_AGENT --json
evopilot project llm set <project-id> --profile my-agent-llm --require-llm-ready --json
evopilot target plan \
  --project <project-id> \
  --objective "Enable tenant-level onboarding, full lifecycle Dashboard visibility, and operator repair guidance for the project" \
  --client workbuddy \
  --json

evopilot target plan export <goal-id> --format json > /tmp/evopilot-phase-plan.json
evopilot target plan diff <goal-id> --file /tmp/evopilot-phase-plan.json --json
evopilot target plan apply <goal-id> --file /tmp/evopilot-phase-plan.json --json
evopilot target plan approve <goal-id> --json

evopilot target run \
  --project <project-id> \
  --objective "Enable tenant-level onboarding, full lifecycle Dashboard visibility, and operator repair guidance for the project" \
  --until terminal \
  --max-steps 20 \
  --require-source-ready \
  --require-devops-ready \
  --llm-profile my-agent-llm \
  --require-llm-ready \
  --client workbuddy \
  --json
```

The raw LLM API key is stored once in the EvoPilot server-side secret vault. Daily `target run`, `goal run`, and `loop run` commands pass only the LLM profile id. If `--llm-profile` is omitted, EvoPilot uses the project default LLM binding, then the server's configured global default LLM.

`--objective` is the user's business objective, not a maturity label. The terminal maturity is GA by default, and EvoPilot decomposes every governed goal through Alpha, Beta, RC, and GA. Wrapper commands stop at `PENDING_PLAN_APPROVAL` unless `--auto-approve-plan` is explicitly supplied, so WorkBuddy or a human operator can review, edit, diff, apply, and approve the generated phase plan before execution. WorkBuddy or any digital-human simulation should treat phase-plan review as a required user confirmation step; `--auto-approve-plan` is reserved for already-authorized unattended automation.

Wrapper JSON output includes `llmUsage.summary.provider`, `llmUsage.summary.model`, input/output/total token counts, credits consumed, process `requestId` values, and server-side Loop executor usage. Start with [docs/cli/README.md](docs/cli/README.md) for CLI setup, [docs/cli/automation.md](docs/cli/automation.md) for WorkBuddy parsing rules, and [docs/guides/ai-agent-runbook.md](docs/guides/ai-agent-runbook.md) for the full production runbook.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the primary product surface for operators and tenant users, but it now lives in the standalone `yeliang-wang/evopilot-dashboard` repository. EvoPilot itself focuses on the API server, CLI, domain state, release governance, and execution control plane. The standalone Dashboard consumes EvoPilot APIs and includes the GlobalGoal Cockpit for RC/GA workflow visibility.

| Role | Main workflows |
|---|---|
| Platform admin | Create tenants, manage tenant admins, inspect SaaS readiness, observe cross-tenant release health. |
| Tenant admin | Manage workspace users, bind projects, configure credentials, run target loops, approve source/release actions. |
| Tenant user | Inspect projects, evidence, loop progress, approvals assigned to them, release decisions, and help manual steps. |

The full browser operation guide lives in the standalone Dashboard repository under `docs/`. EvoPilot keeps the API/CLI/control-plane guide in [docs/guides/user-guide.md](docs/guides/user-guide.md).

## Architecture

EvoPilot applies Loop Engineering to product evolution. For larger business objectives, the GlobalGoal layer sits above LoopRun and turns one global objective into Alpha -> Beta -> RC -> GA phase GoalTargets before each target is executed through the governed loop runtime:

```text
GlobalGoal -> GoalTarget -> LoopRun -> Release Decision
                  |
                  v
Sandbox -> Context -> Harness -> Loop
```

| Layer | EvoPilot responsibility |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | Isolated execution boundaries, credential scope, protected paths, and deploy constraints. |
| Context | Durable loop state, evidence, artifacts, checkpoints, and replay context. |
| Harness | API control plane, RBAC, audit, worker leases, approvals, retries, and watchdog recovery. |
| Loop | Continue, stop, retry, approve, source-close, release, or route to humans. |

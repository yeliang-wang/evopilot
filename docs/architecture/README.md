# Architecture

> EvoPilot is an API and CLI control plane for governed AI Agent product evolution.

## Product Split

```text
AI Agent / CI / Operator
        |
        v
EvoPilot CLI  --->  EvoPilot API Server  ---> Evidence / Audit / Release State
                         ^
                         |
                 EvoPilot Dashboard
```

EvoPilot owns the domain model and execution state. The Dashboard is a replaceable UI client that consumes the API.

## Bounded Contexts

| Context | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Project | Registered products, source credentials, workspace ownership |
| Evidence | Runtime signals, trace/log/eval ingestion, evidence bundles |
| GlobalGoal | Goal decomposition into GoalTargets, progress, graph, timeline, final report |
| Loop Runtime | LoopRun execution, worker leases, sandbox proof, trace, events, replay |
| Source Closure | Writeback, review decision, merge/promotion gates |
| Release Governance | ReleaseTarget profiles and authoritative release decisions |
| CLI Adapter | Atomic commands and wrapper commands over the API |
| Dashboard Adapter | Visual workflow and operations UI over the API |

## Key Rule

The Dashboard can visualize and request actions, but only EvoPilot API state can decide what happened. Release conclusions come from release decisions, not UI inference.
